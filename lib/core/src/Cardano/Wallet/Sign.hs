-- | This module provides an interface for interacting with the additive signing
-- functions of cardano-wallet.
--
-- Its purpose is to provide a low-level algebra (it works directly on the
-- cardano-api types) that allows signatures to be added to an existing Tx,
-- while maintaining the following important properties:
--
-- 1. Under no circumstances will the algebra modify or destroy existing
-- witnesses of the Tx (sign/witnesses-preserved)
--     ∀tx (f :: Sign era -> Sign era)
--     . getTxWitnesses tx
--       ⊆ getTxWitnesses (toSigned (f (fromSigned tx)))
--
-- sign/fromSigned/toSigned/noop:
--     ∀tx. toSigned (fromSigned tx) = tx
-- sign/addWitness/alwaysAdds:
--     ∀ws x. addWitness w x ≠ x
-- sign/addWitnesses/empty-is-noop:
--     ∀ws x. addWitnesses [] x = x
-- sign/addWitnesses/addWitness:
--     ∀ws x. addWitnesses ws x = foldr (.) id (fmap addWitness ws) x
-- sign/fromSigned/fromUnsigned:
--     ∀tx. fromSigned tx = fromUnsigned (getTxBody tx)
--                          & addWitnesses (getTxWitnesses tx)
-- sign/fromUnsigned/fromSigned:
--     ∀txBody. fromUnsigned txBody = fromSigned $ Tx txBody []
-- sign/addWitness/increases-number-of-witnesses
--     ∀w x. length (getTxWitnesses (toSigned (addWitness w x)))
--           = length (getTxWitnesses (toSigned x)) + 1
-- sign/addWitness/adds-a-witness
--     ∀w x. getTxWitnesses (toSigned (addWitness w x))
